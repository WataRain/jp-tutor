# jp-tutor
    Suite of programs to help Japanese language learning

Note: this program uses the [VOICEVOX Engine](https://github.com/VOICEVOX/voicevox_engine). Please follow the set up instructions in the link before using this!

Currently, the program is a proof of concept -- successfully running it will lead to a demonstration of a "dictation" quiz, where you have to write down the words being dictated.
